# JS 1

## Nested Tasks
- Change default task list to hide all tasks.
- Let users click an 'open' icon to expand a given task list.
- When the task list is expanded, change the icon to a 'close' icon.
- Close all other tasks lists when one task list is opened.
- Include a CSS transition to animate opening and closeing task lists.
Note: CSS properties can _not_ transition from and to
'auto', so you will need to find a creative solution for this one.

## Flash Message
- Hide the default flash message after 5 seconds. Note: read Mozilla
docs for
[setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setTimeout).
- Add a 'close button' to the flash message, so users can remove it before the default 5 seconds

## Date Picker
- Include a date picker for time fields.

## Late Tasks
- Give today's tasks a light orange background.
- Give late tasks a light red background.
- Update task color if the date is changed.

## Plugin fun
- Include any plugin from unheap.com.
